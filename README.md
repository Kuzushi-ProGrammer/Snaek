# Snaek
Remake of popular hit indie game snake!

I'm not trying to do anything special here I just got bored over the weekend and started making this :P

Also I know this isn't my original concept for a game but please don't go around saying that you coded it thanks ^^

# ---- Instructions ---- #
1. Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads (Any 3.X.X version should work but if it's having issues install version 3.7)
2. Make sure you have python installed properly by running 'python' in the command prompt (If not reinstalling all versions of python can help)
3. Run the command "py -m pip install --upgrade pip" (Without the quotes) in the command prompt
4. After pip is installed run the following commands:
  - pip install pygame
  - pip install pygame-menu
5. Now you can enjoy watching white boxes move around the screen collecting red boxes!
